Simple algorithm to detect if a point is inside a triangle.

![points inside or outside of a triangle](https://github.com/RaduHaulica/Point-inside-triangle/blob/08b7852d9c64d2abf57f218e313263121c56afb9/inside%20triangle/media/inside%20triangle%20main.gif)

First three clicks create a triangle.

Subsequent clicks add points that are either green (inside) or red (outside).

The algorithm uses dot product to figure out if new points are all on the same side of each of the triangle's sides.
